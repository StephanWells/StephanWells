I eagerly awaited the semi-weekly updates as he worked, he quickly made revisions on request, and the final product surpassed my original expectations. I still listen to it years later!"

Stephan created an animated video to complement the music where he worked with existing art assets to create a beautiful piece of work. This elevated our project even higher and allowed us to reach a wider audience as a result."

Stephan has produced many wonderful creations over the years, and as a long time fan of his music, I commissioned some of his work for my game. His music was stunning and so much more than I bargained for. Not only is he easy to work with but such a friendly guy who gets things done in a reasonable time."

His minute attention to detail and love of clean, well-documented code made for one of the smoothest collaborative experiences I've had in a community project. He's organised, focused but knows how to improvise and compromise. Oh, and he's also friendly, knowledgeable and approachable. The whole package!"

I don't remember his scope of work ever causing any major or medium bugs, only minor ones or none at all. He has great organizational and explanatory skills. His general demeanor uplifts the team spirit."
