He's organ-ised, focused but knows how to improvise and compromise. Oh, and he's also friendly, knowledge-able and approachable. The whole package!"

I don't remember his scope of work ever causing any major or medium bugs, only minor ones or none at all. He has great organizational and explanatory skills. His general demeanor uplifts the team spirit."
